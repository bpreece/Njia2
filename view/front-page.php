    Noun. The absolute best online project task-tracking 
    application ever created&mdash;designed especially for 
    small, agile development teams like yours&mdash;your 
    guarantee of success. Because <em>hyperbole</em>!

<h2>Project Tracking for the Ultra-Agile</h2>
<p>
    You're small. You're agile. You get things done.  
</p>
<p>
    You follow process mindfully, not slavishly. You know that 
    process keeps you on track, keeps you focused, but 
    process is a tool, not a goal. You don't let process get 
    in your way. You know that people and results are more 
    important than process.
</p>
<p>
    That's why <strong>Njia!</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Njia is project task tracking distilled to its purest essence; 
    designed for doers, not watchers, for programmers, not program 
    managers, for people who get things done.

<h2>Ceterum Censeo</h2>
<p>
    Ego enim de meo sensu iudico. Nam ita mihi salva re publica 
    vobiscum perfrui liceat, ut ego, quod in hac causa vehementior 
    sum, non atrocitate animi moveorâ€”quis est enim me mitior?
    sed singulari quadam humanitate et misericordia. Seriously? Are
    you reading this?  Just create an account already. Videor enim 
    mihi videre hanc urbem, lucem orbis terrarum atque arcem 
    omnium gentium, subito uno incendio concidentem; cerno 
    animo sepulta in patria miseros atque insepultos acervos 
    civium; versatur mihi ante oculos aspectus Cethegi et furor 
    in vestra caede bacchantis.
